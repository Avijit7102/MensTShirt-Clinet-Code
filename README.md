# full-stack projects(server and database)

# React Js based projects

# MongoDb used for database

# project Description:
# products are showed on the home page from database. For that, first we have to put data on database.
# Routes are private without home page. So you have to log in. And for log in system I used Google Sign In method with   firebase.

# On admin page you can add products, from manage product component you can delete product.

# and on the order component you can see your order history. Which product you buy and what time.

# Deployed in Firebase. Live Link: https://men-t-shirt.web.app/
