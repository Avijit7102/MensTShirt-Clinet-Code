- Built a full-stack project about T-shirt Collection, Where user can select and buy their project.

- React, NOde.Js, MongoDB used in this project.

# project Description:
- products are showed on the home page from database. For that, first we have to put data on database.
- Routes are private without home page. So you have to log in. And for log in system I used Google Sign In method with firebase.
- On admin page you can add products and you can also delete a product.
- you can see all your order history with time when and which product you bought.
- Deployed in Firebase. [Live Link](https://men-t-shirt.web.app/)
